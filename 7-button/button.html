            Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?<br>
            I saw you at the band stand looking pretty slammed<br>
            Did you see me feeding all my drinks to Cam?<br>
            Probably not I guess, you were quite the mess<br>
            And that girl who tagged along there with you<br>
            I never caught her name, but she seemed fucked up too<br>
            From where I sat she looked to be havin' fun<br>
            Keepin' up with you just like I used to<br>
            Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?<br>
            I'm sorry to have ditched out but I was pretty high<br>
            Heard from Leslie that on his stumble home<br>
            Nat was pukin' up all that beer she'd drunk<br>
            Though we didn't talk much, how'd your evening go?<br>
            You barely spoke a word to me besides that slurred, "Hello"<br>
            But I happened to see without even tryin'<br>
            How she laughed with you just like I used to<br>
            Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?<br>
            I woke up to a pair of shoes I've not seen next to mine<br>
            Did you whisper as you crept in through the door<br>
            How you'd never done much like this before?<br>
            I was thinking back just the other day<br>
            Remember when we used to sneak out late to go and blaze?<br>
            Seemed like loneliness was all we'd ever do<br>
            But now she's knowing you just like I used to<br>
